## Introduction
Information technology has become increasingly important in modern life, playing a crucial role in various sectors such as manufacturing and management. The application of IT in these areas has brought about significant benefits, leading to a digital revolution. However, the implementation of technology is not always straightforward, especially in developing countries with a shortage of skilled IT professionals like Vietnam.

Our project, "Flight Ticket Management System," aims to address these challenges by developing user-friendly and efficient software for managing flight ticket sales, ultimately improving the user experience and operational efficiency of airlines.

## Project Objectives
- **Problem to Solve**: Optimize the management of flight ticket sales to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline airline operations.
- **Scope**: Develop a robust software application that caters to the needs of both airlines and passengers by efficiently managing flight schedules, ticket sales, and customer interactions.

## Main Tasks
1. **Requirement Collection and Analysis**: Gather and analyze the system's requirements, identifying the necessary functions and features.
2. **System Interface Design**: Design the user interface to ensure usability and accessibility.
3. **Backend Development**: Implement the backend functionalities, including database management and server-side logic.
4. **Testing and Reporting**: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system's functionality and reliability, followed by detailed reporting.

## Requirement Analysis and Modeling
